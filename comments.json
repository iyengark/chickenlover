I have interpreted that to mean that I'll feel good if I think I'm feeling good. And Trump, to his credit, has been feeding a lot of \"feel good\" experiences to his voters.<br/>For one, about 700 jobs were saved in Indiana after a huge tax subsidy was underwritten by Indian tax payers. But to Trump supporters it felt like he accosted Carrier and negotiated successfully. From this they extrapolate and believe that he is the one to save jobs across the country.<br/>When Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, what did Trump do? He ordered a raining of missiles. While most analysts noted that the missile attack had very limited value in damaging Assad's assets or capabilities, Trump voters saw a strong man who made America look powerful. They felt like they were on top of the world, once again.<br/>And most recently he skipped the WHCD choosing instead to attend yet another rally. What did his supporters see? They saw a strong man snub the media and instead spent time among them, even though the reason was more likely that he needed adulation rather than ribbing.<br/>Trump supporters see a man in shining armor riding a white horse who they expect will save America. From what is unclear. Or how is also unclear. But they feel it in their bones. And that makes it real.<br/>Until it isn't!"}

He accuses Team Blue (a nice term, thank you for introducing it to me) \"of squirting down the working class\u2019s leg while telling them that it\u2019s raining\" while conveniently forgetting it is technology that is killing more jobs than immigrants, legal or illegal.<br/>He notes that he \"distrust \u201cmy side\u201d nearly as much as I distrust yours\" meaning that he has no faith in Team Blue or Team Red. That is no argument because we need some form of governance structure. I suppose we could have more political parties with more color codes, but merely noting that neither side is \"trustworthy\" makes no sense. Part of the reason is the entrenched Congressmen/women who through legislative processes carve out districts that help them get reelected. Is Matt ready to call for an amendment that shifts redistricting to nonpartisan panels? "}

It is therefore easy to appeal to the coal mining and manufacturing sector employees by telling them that there is a well identified enemy that is causing their job loss. It is much harder when there is no specific target that can be easily identified.<br/>The simple fact of the matter is that many manufacturing jobs have been automated and in a typical car manufacturing plant one robot replaces three workers. Is any politician going to identify robots as the cause of and therefore the enemy to be rooted out?<br/>A smart and thoughtful politician will take the time to explain that job creation in new sectors with new technologies is the way to blunt these losses, not fight the target enemy to bring back those lost jobs.

As has often been noted in many other contexts, let us not make the perfect the enemy of the good.<br/>Take Obamacare as an example. Even its supporters will agree it was not perfect. There were strong political reasons for its enactment. But, if our Congress was filled with folks interested in governing and not preening (an accusation that is being hurled at Cuomo on this very subject), they would look at how it is functioning and fine tune it.<br/>So, bottom line, I'm prepared to wait and see how this policy works and then begin to modify it as its effects begin to manifest."}
