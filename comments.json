Whether it is an \"intelligent\" machine or not and whether it can develop \"intelligence\" the way we himans are used to, are really not that interesting questions because the answer is self-evident. Watson, as you and many others have suggested, used brute force. And that brings me to one of the ways in which we could measure Watson's success against the two human contestants: weight. The human brain weighs a few pounds, but Watson's \"brain\" weighs a few thousand pounds. And, in that sense, the human brain is still a wonderous piece of machinery!"}

Bravo! Good luck on implementing some of the suggested changes though. If I sound pessimistic, it is because I have studies some of these issues and understand the difficulties involved in bringing about the requisite attitudinal and behavioral changes. Take for instance the idea of changing over to a plant based diet. Give up beef? Beef is about as sacred to the American diet as cow is to the Indian! Take the idea of home cooking for another. The average American lacks the time, knowledge and interest needed to cook at home. Recently I was at a party when a 30-year old married woman told that she would not know what to do with a bunch of broccoli. And yet she must have eaten it many times at a restaurant. She lacked the knowledge, for sure, but more importantly, she did not show any interest in correcting that situation. Next, take the idea of reducing waste. It is fashionable to over-order and waste rather than under-order and feel slightly less than fully satiated. Every time I have eaten at a restaurant, I am amazed at the cavalier manner in which kids order at a table near us. Adults accompanying them do not intervene and suggest that they limit their ordering and not waste food. Invariably the kids plate(s) goes (go) back less than half eaten. Lastly, take the idea of recycling. This is one of the hardest behaviors to instill. Yet, this is the only one I am most optimistic about. This generation of kids has been exposed to recycling from a young age, and thus I believe they will recycle more readily when they become adults.<br />So, the bottom line is that we need a major overhaul in the American attitude and values, and these are the hardest to change."}

The results presented by these researchers are obvious, at least to me and I am glad that there is empirical evidence to support my belief. However, there is a substantial segment in America that believes in free markets to an absurd degree so much so that they will not recognize the cancerous effects of extreme inequality. Not surprisingly these will be Americans viewing Fox News (I cringe in combining Fox with news) living in red states, who for some absurd reason do not see the value of a more egalitarian society. Their unshakable faith in the American dream makes them believe that anyone with grit and hard work will become rich. Its very much like kids growing in the ghettos and projects believing that they too can make it in the NBA. Little do they know that the odds are stacked against them and that a more egalitarian society is their best bet for a better life. "}

And, as Putnam and Campbell note, this is a recipe for prejudice.\"<br /><br />I agree that the population of Muslims is small. But what about the Hindus? Jains? Buddhists? Shintoists? I suspect each of these religious communities must have an even smaller population, yet do not appear on anyone's radar. Why? I wonder."}

Kirkpatrick was endlessly arguing that Gates and Zuckerberg were visionaries because they persisted with their idea and saw it come to fruition. But as Wright points out, there must have been hundreds of people who had the same or similar ideas and who persisted just like Gates and Zuckerberg, yet failed because they were not helped by positive externalities.  We always hear success stories and so naturally assume that perseverance paid off. If instead, we dug deeper into the failed efforts, we'd see that negative externalities was what did them in. I don't want to suggest that gates and Zuckerberg are useless <profanity>idiots</profanity>, far from it, but I do want to shift more of the credit to positive externalities. This whole idea of a genius who comes out of the blue and saves the world is a relic from the distant past religious scriptures. Moses saved the Jews, Rama saved Sita, Krishna saved the world, Jesus continues to save us from ourselves and on and on and on. Not that these people were not great, but it just ain't so simple, it takes more than one person and lots of positive externalities (you could also call it dumb luck, but that wouldn't be fair either) to make somebody or something successful.<br />"}

Now, you will suddely see more players move to doubles. Not only that, they will try to forge more permanent partnerships, like the Bryan brothers have done, who other than that they are brothers may not have been as regularly partnering each other. And, CBS will devote more TV time. And more fans will flock to thos courts. So, my friends, it is all in the amount of money. Just take a look at the evolution of women's tennis from a time when only the semi-finals and finals were worth watching to today when even an early round can be potentially interesting.

It all started with the invasion of Iraq, one justified because the USA could/would never wage an unjust war. Once you buy into that theory, the next step is to propose American exceptionalism - there is no country like ours, no harder working people, none more honest, none with a shred of evil, always working to advance democracy and human rights, and yada yada yada. All of this nicely leads to conclude that evil acts by Americans are done by evil individuals whereas evil acts by others are done because of their group identity, be it religion, ethnicity, nationality, family, or tribe.  A very dangerous trend, one that is being fueled and exploited by the likes of Palin, Beck, Limbaugh on a daily basis, only to be frequently joined in by the pompous Gingrich from time to time."}

Maybe he should consider withdrawing driving privileges to his wife. After all, they do not let women drive in Saudi Arabia. And, others like Palin think it is too close to the WTC. Well, how close is close? Apparently Alaska is close enough to Russia to be knowledgeable about Russian culture and politics. So, Tom, while I applaud your commentary I am worried about the likes of Palin and Gingrich who will politicize anything using any twisted logic."}
