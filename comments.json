He accuses Team Blue (a nice term, thank you for introducing it to me) \"of squirting down the working class\u2019s leg while telling them that it\u2019s raining\" while conveniently forgetting it is technology that is killing more jobs than immigrants, legal or illegal.<br/>He notes that he \"distrust \u201cmy side\u201d nearly as much as I distrust yours\" meaning that he has no faith in Team Blue or Team Red. That is no argument because we need some form of governance structure. I suppose we could have more political parties with more color codes, but merely noting that neither side is \"trustworthy\" makes no sense. Part of the reason is the entrenched Congressmen/women who through legislative processes carve out districts that help them get reelected. Is Matt ready to call for an amendment that shifts redistricting to nonpartisan panels? "}

North Korea and America share a similarity in their leaders. As Ms. Collins notes, both are \"narcissistic to the point of psychosis, with a celebrity fixation and a very strange haircut.\" Maybe this will be helpful. And Dennis Rodman can be the go between!"}

It is therefore easy to appeal to the coal mining and manufacturing sector employees by telling them that there is a well identified enemy that is causing their job loss. It is much harder when there is no specific target that can be easily identified.<br/>The simple fact of the matter is that many manufacturing jobs have been automated and in a typical car manufacturing plant one robot replaces three workers. Is any politician going to identify robots as the cause of and therefore the enemy to be rooted out?<br/>A smart and thoughtful politician will take the time to explain that job creation in new sectors with new technologies is the way to blunt these losses, not fight the target enemy to bring back those lost jobs. But then again that takes both smartness and honesty, two characteristics notably absent among our representatives. ."}

When Trump says that the earth is flat, they should not be bringing in the one person who believes it and have him debate the issue with another person (who is one from a billion) giving the impression of \"fairness.\" They need to call a spade a spade.<br/>This is where satire and comedy comes into play. Our comedians are doing a much better job of covering Trump than the standard issue journalist. The one exception maybe Jake Tapper.

It says that the Left left behind some Americans who then switched to vote for the other team. It makes for a cute use of the word \"left\" but is otherwise incorrect.<br/>The jobs recover rate was slower in the nonmetropolitan areas; that much is a fact. But it is a giant leap from there to say that they were left behind. For one, there was a big public investment that helped some of the unemployed. It was not big enough because of the right. And then there was the healthcare access that must have helped offset some economic hardship and mental tension. Here too, it is worth noting that there was uniform opposition from the right. And then in 2015-16 the slow growth and recovery was pinned on the left by the right with Trump leading the charge. Somewhere in all of this was the trumped up toxic charge that Obama was a secret Kenyan Muslim.<br/>And now reading the title of this column makes my head spin. We have truly entered a new world where up is down and left is right.<br/>Yes, the left is right and the right is wrong! "}

intellectual as one possessing intellect, which is defines as \"the faculty of reasoning and understanding objectively, especially with regard to abstract or academic matters.\" To the extent that \"reasoning and understanding objectively\" have taken a back seat to instant gratification and twitter-mania, I agree that there is less and less weight placed on intellectualism and intellectuals. This is not so much because intellectual have been wrong in the past - of course they have been - but because our attention span has been scaled down to 140 characters or less. For that matter, even TED talks that feature scholars is limited to 18 minutes.<br/>Time impoverishment and attention deficit have forced intellectuals to now be pithy and evangelical. And that is why they have had to become \"thought leaders\" who champion \"one big idea to improve the world.\"<br/>The winds of change are upon us; the 20th century intellectual who embraced and advanced broad perspectives has been replaced by a 21st century thought-leader who proselytizes one idea at a time.

Trump says he's save 1100 jobs in Indiana, and the media swoons even though that was factually incorrect and insignificant from a jobs policy perspective. Trump addresses Congress in complete sentences for almost one hour, and pundits anoint him as being presidential. And most recently, he authorized missile strikes in Syria and he is seen as being decisive.<br/>I can understand his supporters feeling elated as these events unfolded. After all they are favorably disposed toward him and these actions seem impressive. But the pundits? The media? C'mon folks, you can do better than that.<br/>Taxing Indiana citizens to save 700 jobs is not exactly a jobs creation program that can be sustained. Speaking at length somewhat coherently? Now that's what high school students are taught to do. And firing missiles does not signify the end of any conflict.<br/>A magician who distracts his audience for producing an effect. The audience cheers, because they know they have been fooled. They are befuddled but they love it. Governance is serious business and no laughing matter. It is high time the media stopped cheering."}

"Comparing the homeless or the drug addict, for whom the liberals seem to have sympathy, to the Trump voter, for whom the liberals seem not to have sympathy, is superficial and does not do justice to the liberal. The superficial similarity is that both, the homeless or drug addict and the Trump voter, may have made bad choices and hence need our sympathy. But a second look informs us that the drug addicts choice does not potentially cause harm to society in the same manner that a bad choice for a President would. In case of the drug addict, the damages will be mostly to the person, his/her family &amp; friends, and maybe the larger public will have to bear added costs to support treatment or rehabilitation. By electing Trump these voters have increased the chances of a catastrophe much larger than that. The potential for a war, even a nuclear war, with North Korea is growing stronger every day. Making such a comparison is facile but it is improper, but at least had a modicum of humanity.<br/><br/>By when you write that \"Democrats didn\u2019t do enough do address this suffering\" (the Trump voter's suffering, that is) I lost you. I am sure you are more than aware that the red states have a net inflow of federal funds that are largely fed by the blue states. There is a redistribution going on and it is in favor of the Trump voter. And yet they believe in small government, one that promises healthcare for all and then cuts out 24 million Americans.<br/><br/>The two are not the same. Period."}

"\"Passing major social legislation is fantastically difficult. It tends to involve taking something from influential interest groups \u2014 taxing the rich, for example (as Obamacare did), or reducing some companies\u2019 profits or hurting professional guilds.\"<br/>Leonhardt correctly notes that almost all government regulations will involve some redistribution of benefits and welfare. This is the basic social contract which binds citizens and their elected officials. Most folks would like such redistribution to flow from the rich to the poor, from those who are fortunate to have resources to those who are less fortunate and have fewer resources.<br/>However, ever since St. Reagan began his diatribe against government, many but not all Americans have come to view government regulations as a nuisance rather than a welcome intervention. Granted that many government programs are less that efficient but so are many private enterprises.<br/>But in collectively identifying the rich as potential barriers to social reform, Leonhardt does disservice to the many rich and middle-class Americans who believe in a significant role for the government. Just look at some prominent rich folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet; they are more than willing to pay additional taxes if it will enhance the welfare of the less fortunate."}

This much is true and would be horrific, as it is is, except that there are checks-and-balances in the American system of governance. Right? Wrong!<br/>He now has enablers in Congress with Speaker Ryan at its head. He has members in the GOP defending the indefensible. He has subverted the process with his bullying tactics. After all that is the way he has run his family business - bully the workers, stiff the suppliers and creditors. That he is able to continue with the tactics at the highest level of government is a pox on the GOP and our elected representatives. <br/><br/>We, the people, need to get more involved and active in reshaping the Congress in 2018.

And he makes sure that the people around him like to run their bodies on the same jet fuel, if not he berates them in public until they succumb. This much was, and is, obvious.<br/><br/>But, as Prof. Krugman speculates, \"there\u2019s also something going on in our society: Many Americans no longer seem to understand what a leader is supposed to sound like, mistaking bombast and belligerence for real toughness.\"<br/><br/>American society was always fueled by machismo all the way from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood. The difference was that they were movie actors portraying tough guys and entertained us. And the real macho leaders, like Teddy Roosevelt, were more than just empty bravado; they also had a brain that functioned. But what has happened today is that the thin line between acting and real life has become blurred. Take the so-called reality shows. Or the WWE run wrestling. Are they real? By now most of us know that the reality portrayed in these shows are actually doctored and faked. <br/><br/>But when the POTUS lets his fingers dance on the keyboard and limits his speech to 140 characters even as he appoints men without character to positions of authority, the entertainment aspect has been drained and the terror of real reality has set in. And that is scary."}

Thus, the term secular purism is an oxymoron and has no meaning.<br/>Please tell your friend that there are no secular demons living in any closet, maybe only in his mind."}

Let me rebut them.<br/>\"First, the crisis of opportunity.\" This is partially because of globalization. It was politically expedient to blame the Chinese and Indians for taking away American jobs. And maliciously exploited by Trump in the recent election. But no one talks about automation. Three robots replace one factory worker. Yes, opportunities were less for those with fewer skills but Obama was pilloried when he suggested expanding access to vocational education.<br/>\"Second, the crisis of solidarity.\" The social fabric disintegrates when one's stresses due to unemployment is compounded by lack of access to healthcare. By now all of us should know who has been crowing from the rooftops about wanting to dismantle Obamacare. Enough said.<br/>\"Third, the crisis of authority.\" When the POTUS lies incessantly and tweets baseless allegations, little wonder trust in institutions is lost. Obama had eight full and scandal free years; Trump has yet to have eight full hours without uttering a lie.<br/>So Prof. Brooks, your analysis is incomplete until you do not identify the culprits who prevented Americans from getting vocational training, denying access to healthcare, and lying to the point where people stop trusting institutions. By not identifying these culprits you seem to suggest an equivalence that is false. Come out and say what you have to say. It is time you called a spade a spade! "}

They are used by people to either benefit or harm society. Whether they are used to benefit or harm depends on two elements: prevailing laws and institutions as also on the capacity for critical thinking among people. Currently we have failure in at least one of these two elements. Our citizens capacity to critically think and screen information is woefully absent. People are wont to pass along anything that comes into their inbox. The internet merely amplifies our collective inability to think critically."}

More likely it was a recipe to cook the election.<br/>Also follow the money. Why hasn't Trump released his tax returns? No banks in America would lend him money. He was not a good credit risk. Remember how he got others to bail him out 20 years ago and stuck them with the debt while he took the tax write off? Overseas banks with Russian connections must have lent him the money. As Deep Throat said, \"Follow the money.\""}

Every action of his has been calculated to improve his and his family business' standing. <br/><br/>In promoting this narrow idea of nationalism, Trump has exploited the free movement of people and the resultant relocation across the globe. Just like in the UK, immigrants to the USA have added net value. They do jobs for which there are not enough qualified Americans such as software and engineering or jobs that Americans are loathe to doing such as hard labor on a farm. And yet they are used as punching bags by Trump and his minions.<br/><br/>This also conveniently overlooks the real force at work, i.e., technological revolution that has made possible for robots to replace workers at the rate of 3-to-1. The real solution is for more Americans to get better educated and become a part of the new technological world that is only going to get more technology driven.<br/><br/>Brexiters and Trumpsters have let their anger morph into a short sighted movement that may temporarily salve their angst but will hurt the country and the world in the long run."}
