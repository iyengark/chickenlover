He accuses Team Blue (a nice term, thank you for introducing it to me) \"of squirting down the working class\u2019s leg while telling them that it\u2019s raining\" while conveniently forgetting it is technology that is killing more jobs than immigrants, legal or illegal.<br/>He notes that he \"distrust \u201cmy side\u201d nearly as much as I distrust yours\" meaning that he has no faith in Team Blue or Team Red. That is no argument because we need some form of governance structure. I suppose we could have more political parties with more color codes, but merely noting that neither side is \"trustworthy\" makes no sense. Part of the reason is the entrenched Congressmen/women who through legislative processes carve out districts that help them get reelected. Is Matt ready to call for an amendment that shifts redistricting to nonpartisan panels? "}

It is therefore easy to appeal to the coal mining and manufacturing sector employees by telling them that there is a well identified enemy that is causing their job loss. It is much harder when there is no specific target that can be easily identified.<br/>The simple fact of the matter is that many manufacturing jobs have been automated and in a typical car manufacturing plant one robot replaces three workers. Is any politician going to identify robots as the cause of and therefore the enemy to be rooted out?<br/>A smart and thoughtful politician will take the time to explain that job creation in new sectors with new technologies is the way to blunt these losses, not fight the target enemy to bring back those lost jobs.

But, if our Congress was filled with folks interested in governing and not preening (an accusation that is being hurled at Cuomo on this very subject), they would look at how it is functioning and fine tune it.<br/>So, bottom line, I'm prepared to wait and see how this policy works and then begin to modify it as its effects begin to manifest."}

This is a good lesson for protesters to follow.<br/>But what about the fawning media? They are perplexed in how to cover Trump. This is where they need to abandon their long-held belief in \"balanced\" coverage. When Trump says that the earth is flat, they should not be bringing in the one person who believes it and have him debate the issue with another person (who is one from a billion) giving the impression of \"fairness.\" They need to call a spade a spade.<br/>This is where satire and comedy comes into play. Our comedians are doing a much better job of covering Trump than the standard issue journalist. The one exception maybe Jake Tapper.

It makes for a cute use of the word \"left\" but is otherwise incorrect.<br/>The jobs recover rate was slower in the nonmetropolitan areas; that much is a fact. But it is a giant leap from there to say that they were left behind. For one, there was a big public investment that helped some of the unemployed. It was not big enough because of the right. And then there was the healthcare access that must have helped offset some economic hardship and mental tension. Here too, it is worth noting that there was uniform opposition from the right. And then in 2015-16 the slow growth and recovery was pinned on the left by the right with Trump leading the charge. Somewhere in all of this was the trumped up toxic charge that Obama was a secret Kenyan Muslim.<br/>And now reading the title of this column makes my head spin. We have truly entered a new world where up is down and left is right.<br/>Yes, the left is right and the right is wrong! "}

intellectual as one possessing intellect, which is defines as \"the faculty of reasoning and understanding objectively, especially with regard to abstract or academic matters.\" To the extent that \"reasoning and understanding objectively\" have taken a back seat to instant gratification and twitter-mania, I agree that there is less and less weight placed on intellectualism and intellectuals. This is not so much because intellectual have been wrong in the past - of course they have been - but because our attention span has been scaled down to 140 characters or less. For that matter, even TED talks that feature scholars is limited to 18 minutes.<br/>Time impoverishment and attention deficit have forced intellectuals to now be pithy and evangelical. And that is why they have had to become \"thought leaders\" who champion \"one big idea to improve the world.\"<br/>The winds of change are upon us; the 20th century intellectual who embraced and advanced broad perspectives has been replaced by a 21st century thought-leader who proselytizes one idea at a time.

Trump says he's save 1100 jobs in Indiana, and the media swoons even though that was factually incorrect and insignificant from a jobs policy perspective. Trump addresses Congress in complete sentences for almost one hour, and pundits anoint him as being presidential. And most recently, he authorized missile strikes in Syria and he is seen as being decisive.<br/>I can understand his supporters feeling elated as these events unfolded. After all they are favorably disposed toward him and these actions seem impressive. But the pundits? The media? C'mon folks, you can do better than that.<br/>Taxing Indiana citizens to save 700 jobs is not exactly a jobs creation program that can be sustained. Speaking at length somewhat coherently? Now that's what high school students are taught to do. And firing missiles does not signify the end of any conflict.<br/>A magician who distracts his audience for producing an effect. The audience cheers, because they know they have been fooled. They are befuddled but they love it. Governance is serious business and no laughing matter. It is high time the media stopped cheering."}

"Comparing the homeless or the drug addict, for whom the liberals seem to have sympathy, to the Trump voter, for whom the liberals seem not to have sympathy, is superficial and does not do justice to the liberal. The superficial similarity is that both, the homeless or drug addict and the Trump voter, may have made bad choices and hence need our sympathy. But a second look informs us that the drug addicts choice does not potentially cause harm to society in the same manner that a bad choice for a President would. In case of the drug addict, the damages will be mostly to the person, his/her family &amp; friends, and maybe the larger public will have to bear added costs to support treatment or rehabilitation. By electing Trump these voters have increased the chances of a catastrophe much larger than that. The potential for a war, even a nuclear war, with North Korea is growing stronger every day. Making such a comparison is facile but it is improper, but at least had a modicum of humanity.<br/><br/>By when you write that \"Democrats didn\u2019t do enough do address this suffering\" (the Trump voter's suffering, that is) I lost you. I am sure you are more than aware that the red states have a net inflow of federal funds that are largely fed by the blue states. There is a redistribution going on and it is in favor of the Trump voter. And yet they believe in small government, one that promises healthcare for all and then cuts out 24 million Americans.<br/><br/>The two are not the same. Period."}

(Vice President Mike Pence gathered them up, and the White House claims that they were signed later.)\"<br/>This continues to show that Trump is driven by ego and self-interest and that everyone around him is an enabler. During the campaign it was Christie who was publicly shamed on numerous occasions. Now it is the Veep who picks up the unsigned executive orders and brings them along to his master's chambers for obtaining his signature.<br/>How do these folks around him put up with this guy? Does not even one of them have the sense to call him on his outrageous and infantile behaviors? Are they so power hungry that they want to be seen near this man-child hoping that he'll drop them a bone from time to time?<br/>That Trump is an empty vessel was, and continues to be, obvious. When will his sycophants tell him he's naked?"}

"\"Passing major social legislation is fantastically difficult. It tends to involve taking something from influential interest groups \u2014 taxing the rich, for example (as Obamacare did), or reducing some companies\u2019 profits or hurting professional guilds.\"<br/>Leonhardt correctly notes that almost all government regulations will involve some redistribution of benefits and welfare. This is the basic social contract which binds citizens and their elected officials. Most folks would like such redistribution to flow from the rich to the poor, from those who are fortunate to have resources to those who are less fortunate and have fewer resources.<br/>However, ever since St. Reagan began his diatribe against government, many but not all Americans have come to view government regulations as a nuisance rather than a welcome intervention. Granted that many government programs are less that efficient but so are many private enterprises.<br/>But in collectively identifying the rich as potential barriers to social reform, Leonhardt does disservice to the many rich and middle-class Americans who believe in a significant role for the government. Just look at some prominent rich folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet; they are more than willing to pay additional taxes if it will enhance the welfare of the less fortunate."}

And he makes sure that the people around him like to run their bodies on the same jet fuel, if not he berates them in public until they succumb. This much was, and is, obvious.<br/><br/>But, as Prof. Krugman speculates, \"there\u2019s also something going on in our society: Many Americans no longer seem to understand what a leader is supposed to sound like, mistaking bombast and belligerence for real toughness.\"<br/><br/>American society was always fueled by machismo all the way from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood. The difference was that they were movie actors portraying tough guys and entertained us. And the real macho leaders, like Teddy Roosevelt, were more than just empty bravado; they also had a brain that functioned. But what has happened today is that the thin line between acting and real life has become blurred. Take the so-called reality shows. Or the WWE run wrestling. Are they real? By now most of us know that the reality portrayed in these shows are actually doctored and faked. <br/><br/>But when the POTUS lets his fingers dance on the keyboard and limits his speech to 140 characters even as he appoints men without character to positions of authority, the entertainment aspect has been drained and the terror of real reality has set in. And that is scary."}

But in your attempt to agreeably disagree with Rod Dreher,  you propose the concept of secular purism in juxtaposition to religious purism. Religion and its messiahs were invariably purists; their only goal was to advance religious orthodoxy. On the other hand, secularists were invariably trying to dismantle such orthodoxy, not create a new one. Thus, the term secular purism is an oxymoron and has no meaning.<br/>Please tell your friend that there are no secular demons living in any closet, maybe only in his mind."}

Let me rebut them.<br/>\"First, the crisis of opportunity.\" This is partially because of globalization. It was politically expedient to blame the Chinese and Indians for taking away American jobs. And maliciously exploited by Trump in the recent election. But no one talks about automation. Three robots replace one factory worker. Yes, opportunities were less for those with fewer skills but Obama was pilloried when he suggested expanding access to vocational education.<br/>\"Second, the crisis of solidarity.\" The social fabric disintegrates when one's stresses due to unemployment is compounded by lack of access to healthcare. By now all of us should know who has been crowing from the rooftops about wanting to dismantle Obamacare. Enough said.<br/>\"Third, the crisis of authority.\" When the POTUS lies incessantly and tweets baseless allegations, little wonder trust in institutions is lost. Obama had eight full and scandal free years; Trump has yet to have eight full hours without uttering a lie.<br/>So Prof. Brooks, your analysis is incomplete until you do not identify the culprits who prevented Americans from getting vocational training, denying access to healthcare, and lying to the point where people stop trusting institutions. By not identifying these culprits you seem to suggest an equivalence that is false. Come out and say what you have to say. It is time you called a spade a spade! "}

They are used by people to either benefit or harm society. Whether they are used to benefit or harm depends on two elements: prevailing laws and institutions as also on the capacity for critical thinking among people. Currently we have failure in at least one of these two elements. Our citizens capacity to critically think and screen information is woefully absent. People are wont to pass along anything that comes into their inbox. The internet merely amplifies our collective inability to think critically."}

Listen closely to the chatter about Trump campaigners contacting Russian officials prior to the election. Follow that lead. What were they discussion? I am sure it wasn't recipes to bake a cake. More likely it was a recipe to cook the election.<br/>Also follow the money. Why hasn't Trump released his tax returns? No banks in America would lend him money. He was not a good credit risk. Remember how he got others to bail him out 20 years ago and stuck them with the debt while he took the tax write off? Overseas banks with Russian connections must have lent him the money. As Deep Throat said, \"Follow the money.\""}

Just like in the UK, immigrants to the USA have added net value. They do jobs for which there are not enough qualified Americans such as software and engineering or jobs that Americans are loathe to doing such as hard labor on a farm.

The real solution is for more Americans to get better educated and become a part of the new technological world that is only going to get more technology driven.<br/><br/>Brexiters and Trumpsters have let their anger morph into a short sighted movement that may temporarily salve their angst but will hurt the country and the world in the long run."}

important question: Why do people vote against their self-interest and elect hucksters? In answering this question he misses an important point - education, or to be more precise, the lack of it.<br/>By education I do not mean a high school or college degree, although those are helpful. By education I mean awareness and knowledge of one's location in the universe and our impact on the surrounding micro and macro ecosystems. If only people paused to think about these matters, we'd be more thoughtful in our actions and elect sensible folks to be our leaders. Unfortunately pettiness rules and is being peddled and provoked. Evreryone is asked to think of none other than oneself. We believe we are an island.<br/>Sadly and scarily this leads to all the outcomes Cohen talks about."}

But, in the process, you underestimate the role and importance of enlightened people. Those who crafted these rules were not perfect but were enlightened (mostly) men. All the figures you reference including Lincoln were enlightened folks. I'd add Obama to that list, although you demur and don't reference him.<br/>My point is that merely having enlightened rules is not sufficient. It is a necessary condition but required enlightened men to make it function effectively. And right now we have a carnival barker, which in my book is the opposite of an enlightened person, at the helm of affairs. The result is the chaos we find ourselves in.<br/>Enlightened rules + enlightened people = Rule of Law."}

participation and family formation.\" <br/><br/>I prefer to stay out of people's pants and let families form the way they form. But, as far as workforce participation, I have a simple idea. Why not go to a 36 or even a 32 hour week? What is so sacred about 40-hour week? Automation is here to stay and is already having its impact in various manufacturing sectors. In the automotive sector it is estimated that one robot will replace three workers. <br/><br/>So, why not modify our work week? A 32-hour week will not only expand participation in the workforce but also open up time that could be used for creative pursuits. Who has not heard someone, maybe oneself, say, \"If only I had some free time I'd take up painting or dancing.\" <br/><br/>You wanted radical proposals. Make the work week 32 hours. How is that for a radical proposal?"}

GERRYMANDERING. Districts have been carved out in a manner that protects the incumbent against anyone. BTW, the Dems are also at fault in this regard. It is simply that their districts are more dense and closely packed thereby negating its effectiveness.<br/><br/>As for not demonizing Trump voters and supporters, I have to ask this question: Does a bystander who actively eggs on a racist and homophobic person get a pass because s/he is actually not racist or homophobic? Is it OK to watch a guy vandalize and note that you personally do not support vandalism or vandalize yourself? At the very least Trump supporters are enabling intolerable actions and behaviors.

And lo and behold, the Chinese stop manipulating their currency.<br/><br/>As for Russia annexing Crimea. 45 will take Vlad, his BFF, out to dinner and tell him that that is a no-no. Russian troops will be pulled out even before 45 has settled the dinner tab.<br/><br/>This is one of the most ignorant person. It is the unwillingness to learn that is. "}

title of this column is strange for two reasons.<br/>First, it is only 17 years old, and that too not fully. And it has been written off? It is like telling a high-school kid who's been getting mediocre grades that his life is over. Granted that things may be a bit less than desirable but to dismiss the entire century based on a short period is dispirited and defeatist.<br/>Second, it shows a very American point of view. The \"us\" and the \"we\" are all about America and Americans, ONLY. It is as though the rest of the world doesn't matter. Even if you grant that America casts a large shadow on the world, it is extremely insular and parochial to view the century through nothing but an American lens.<br/>I can see technology replacing human labor which can then be focused on more creative pursuits. But that will only happen if we can see the world through a humanist lens, not just as an input into the productivity hopper. Each one of us is much more than just a component in the assembly line as depicted in Chaplin's \"Modern Times.\" Sadly, out political leaders and captains of industry have yet to evolve to this higher plane of thinking. Until then, it is not the century, but the world and human spirit that are broken."}

this description of our now government. It is dark - listen to all the bad news in the world, look at how the media is always faking news, etc. It is inept - even Hollywood would shy away from a story in which the American President discusses a missile launch in a public place with flashlights from a cell phone.<br/>Truth, as they say, is often stranger than fiction. And nothing can be stranger than how or why 45 got elected. When do you think the Republican party will turn on the president? Many have started to flee this sinking ship, and 45 has not even had one entire month on the job.<br/>Once the Republicans have decided not to attach themselves to this man-baby and open up an investigation into Russiagate, people will begin to talk, just to save their own skin, and things around 45 will begin to fall like dominoes.<br/>Do you think the college-senior-who-never-got-out-of-college Miller or the I-am-in-the-loop-or-oops-am-I-out-of-the-loop Conway will save themselves or protect 45? Forget defending the illegals who streamed into New Hampshire from Massachusetts. Forget putting in a plug for the Ivanka line of clothing. When do you think they'll start singing?<br/>I hope enough Americans, especially those who voted for 45, see that running a private family business does not  automatically give one the ability to run the country."}

There are far more dangerous things in life than the refugees allowed to enter the USA. And guns would be in that list.<br/>However, the logic presented will fall on deaf ears. Many will cite the second amendment and parrot the phrase \"the right to bear arms\"  without quoting the entire amendment. It was written at a time when the country was newly minted and faith in the ability to govern themselves in a democratic system was uncertain. There was the fear tat the government might overrun its own citizens and hence the ability to organize a citizen army (or militia) was formulated as an antidote.<br/>This right to bear arms, in today's context, as far as opposing the government is laughable, at best. A people's militia with the best guns available in the marketplace is no match to the US army's arsenal.<br/>Sadly, this logic will fall on deaf ears. But I thank Kristof for continuing to raise this issue, because that is the only way we are likely to enforce sensible gun regulation. "}

To offset the damages to their standing and brand name, the Democrats must also keep up the pressure in the court of public opinion. And in that court, Trump is at a serious disadvantage.

We have legislators who are supine and fully neutered by Trump. Paul Ryan, the so-called intelligent one leading the GOP, reverses himself so fast and so frequently that his head must be spinning.

Fundamental logic, such as is evident in your arguments, are not the way he thinks or operates; he acts from his gut, as he has himself noted from time to time. That approach helped him get elected, and he assumes it will also help him govern. He does not seem to recognize the big difference between campaigning and governing. And that is the scary part.<br/>The scarier part of this unfolding drama is that many Americans are on board his crazy train. They voted him into office, if not via a majority of votes by number count, but by handing him the electoral college. And now, close to one-half support his thinly veiled Muslim ban. In other words, his supporters are hanging on his coattails even now; they are all in. And that has to be the scarier part.<br/>Members of the GOP are silently following his lead. Very few speak up against his crazy policies. And those who do, do so in muted voices. And only infrequently. They have been neutered.<br/>So, bottom line, Trump is behaving in an irresponsible manner. And many Americans are still in the \"America First\" stupor. The GOP is impotent, often by its own choice. The only hope I have is for the judiciary to rise up, check this megalomaniac, and save us from catastrophe."}

When Trump refuses to take a question from a reporter, any reporter from any news organization, the very next reporter MUST ask the very same question. And, if Trump refuses to answer that reporter, the very next reporter MUST ask the very same question. If Trump continues to refuse answering that question and walks away, which I fully expect him to do, the American public can see his churlish behavior on full display. Let us see how long he can avoid questions, change the topic, or hurl insults at journalists.<br/>C'mon media folks, you can do this, can't you?"}

He is surrounded by crony capitalists who want to keep wages for workers \"under control,\" which essentially means keeping it low.

duty to inform the public and  \u201ctreated their viewers not as citizens, but as so many pairs of eyeballs.\" But singling the media would be a great disservice to other contributors. Here below in no particular order are a few more:<br/><br/>Fox News - Whereas the media may have been complicit in a general sort of manner, Fox news was an active promoter of untruths and half-truths. They took their slogan \"fair and balanced\" to new levels of unfairness and imbalance.<br/><br/>Social Media - All the unchecked and unverified pieces of information that were posted on FaceBook or Twitter freely circulated and, quite often, gained momentum and veracity along the way.<br/><br/>Gullible Americans - Let us call a spade a spade. We, the people, bought into the false information that was being circulated. Basically the skill of critical thinking and triangulation were shelved in favor of forwarding the falsities and half-truths as quickly as it came into our in box.<br/><br/>Into this milieu came The Donald who perfectly played his hand, And now we have him as POTUS. As I've been telling my family &amp; friends and anyone within earshot, it is we, the people, who can brake this runaway freight train. <br/><br/>Welcome to 2017 - Happy New Year!!"}

Absent him and his moderate and supportive stance, we could have had a nuclear <profanity>holocaust</profanity> of unimaginable proportions.<br/>Second, it shows the importance of a steady hand at the helm.

And many of his supporters gobbled it up like it was going out of style.<br/>He maligned Mexicans, and many Latinos voted for him. He abused women, and many women voted for him. He abused Muslims, and many Muslims voted for him. There was not a single demographic segment that he did not antagonize, and yet they all flocked over to him.<br/>He spread miasma, and the people breathed in those noxious fumes and got intoxicated. So, do blame the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, but do not for a minute think that the charlatan did not play Americans for fools."}

However he may be the first one to do so brazenly rather than subtly. And, as we've seen over the past 18+ months of his campaign, he is allowed to get away with his untruths and half-truths making him even more impudent.<br/>Why did this happen? There are many reasons, but an important one has to be the erosion in our critical thinking and a desire to triangulate and verify. A large segment of Americans simply take what is posted on FaceBook at face value. Not only that, these falsities multiply and traverse the universe at lightning speed.<br/>What can we do? For one, speak up and keep speaking up. Don't let lies and falsehood go unchecked. And hope for the best, for in the end those who continue to live and traffic in the world of social media will continue to do so."}
