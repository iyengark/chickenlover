But with a recalcitrant GOP in control of the Congress we are unable to enact common-sense legislation that would go a long way to alleviate the troubles felt by this group of Americans.

It is neither. Using these terms and language is facile because it will allow the French government to invoke certain laws and engage in certain actions, but beyond that it is more dysfunctional than useful.<br/>So, even as we face and counter these atrocities, as we must, let us not fall into the trap of labeling it as war and escalating the situation. In the aftermath of the attacks on the WTC W and his coterie used it as an opportunity to \"spread freedom and democracy\" with disastrous results. So, pause, take a deep breath, and call it what it is - an unprovoked terrorist attack."}

Most modern advanced societies provide support for its citizens through policies that include pre-K child care, paid paternal vacation, more liberal sick days, etc. We in America are left to figure out solutions on our own. Basically government has abandoned its fundamental duty to its citizens.<br/><br/>Moreover, all we hear are snarky remarks from the likes of Jeb Bush who spoke disparagingly of the \"French work week\" while admonishing Marco Rubio. And we have to suffer through the irony displayed in Paul Ryan's unwillingness to compromise on his own family time but offering no support for that in his budget.<br/><br/>It is high time to throw out of office those who do not support social programs that benefit Americans across the board. It is high time America joins other advanced societies and enters the 21st century."}

Let me list you things he did as governor that are unforgettable and indelible:<br/>1. He had Terry Schaivo on life support for weeks just to make a political point.<br/>2. He invalidated thousands of votes so as to get brother W elected.<br/>3. He floated on top a huge housing market boom that he takes credit for but not the crash that followed. <br/><br/>Enough said."}

Fundamentally this is because the view from 30,000 feet up in the sky - which is where policies get framed - is very different from the ground view - which is where most people live every day. This discordance between the national and local perspectives is also driven by NIMBY attitudes. Those framing lenient policies tend to live in less crime ridden neighborhoods, if not, in exclusive gated communities and have no personal experience of the street level crimes. They don't see it in their \"backyards\" and hence assume that nobody sees it in their backyards. Those who live in crime ridden neighborhoods actually experience it very closely and hence call for more stringent punishment.<br/><br/>I have no idea how these two discordant views can be reconciled."}

We are all fortunate to have social security, unemployment insurance, SNAP, and other programs that provide a safety net. <br/><br/>Does that mean we have a socialist economy? No. It only means that we have programs that are common to many modern economies that believe in providing maximum security to its citizens. <br/><br/>Bernie Sanders is exactly what he says he is - a believer in a free market economy, one in which the law of the jungle (might is right) is reined in with common sense and decency."}

Rather blandly he notes that countries with borders that are \"mostly straight lines\" without any correspondence to \"ethnic, tribal or religious realities\" are the ones that are disintegrating. As a bland statement of current reality he is right. But as I said earlier, he fails to mention that it was these very colonial powers that, in their hunger and lust to control this region's natural resources, intentionally drew these rather arbitrary boundaries. And the unintended consequence is what we are witnessing today. <br/><br/>So, even as he notes the chaos permeating through this region, at the very least he needs to mention the role of colonists.

Typically the FED works to preserve the health of the financial system and not of individual financial businesses. In fact many FED officers have publicly stated that they will allow individual institutions to fail in order to preserve the health of the financial sector. However, as we saw, a few banks \"misbehaving\" led to more banks \"misbehavior\" which in turn led to the systemic collapse of the financial sector. <br/><br/>What does this all mean? In complex systems, we often assume that individual actions do not have much of an effect on the entire system. This may be true in some cases and to some degree only. But, just as often, small perturbations lead to unintended and unimagined consequences. We need to be cognizant of this effect and vigilantly guard against it."}

Being part of a team.<br/>4. Empathy becomes a more important workplace skill, the ability to sense what another human being is feeling or thinking.<br/><br/>I get it. No more \"Here is your burger, do you want fries with it\" transactions. Instead it'll be \"How are you feeling today? How can we co-create a burger that will befit your mood\" orientation.<br/><br/>Apparently this emphasis on relationships is important only as we wade into the future. In the past it was \"You can't afford to pay this high a mortgage, but please sign these papers and I'll loan you some money\" transaction. If you signed it, it was your problem because they were not trying to build a relationship with you; they were only transacting with you for your money, and then body and soul. Which, of course, you did not know you were committing to.<br/><br/>It is interesting to read David's gushing love for the future built on relationships that will blossom out of the ashes of past transactions."}

Mitch McConnell continued to fan those flames with his \"make-Obama-a-one-term-President\" idea. Fox News expanded its slate that now included the one and only Sarah Palin herself. Others like Sean Hannity and Mike Huckabee also personally benefited while adding to the craziness. <br/><br/>And now we have Donald Trump. He is the icing on top of this right wingnut cake that has been baking for almost one decade. He does not deserve a single minute's attention except he is getting all the attention. And the idea of not giving him the attention he so craves for is a great one. Except that he will continue to get more and more of it until he burns himself down.<br/><br/>So, let me be bold and make a prediction.  Donald trump will continue to garner more and more attention and media coverage in the foreseeable short term. But he and his flames will be doused out soon thereafter. I can't say when but if I were to guess, I'd say in the next 6-8 months. Stay tuned!!"}
