And they are both scary, very scary.<br/>First, as Daniel Rogers (professor emeritus of history at Princeton) notes, Trumps has an authoritarian style. He brooks no opposition and starts with calling his opponents names, in grade school style, before rising to the level of asking his supporters to physically attack them. After all he has been endorsed by none other than Valdimir Putin, the ultimate strongman. People who hold authoritarian views make up the bulk of his supporters.<br/>Second, the largest segment (estimated at 89.7%) of Trump's supporters are white folk who hold negative views of blacks. In other words, there is more than a hint of racism present in this segment. And the fact that there are 13 million Americans, as evidenced by their vote for him in the primaries, who share this view is scary.<br/>His authoritarian style and racist appeals make Trump's ascendancy atop the GOP very scary. We do need to make America safe again (to borrow the headline from the convention), safe from the likes of Trump becoming POTUS. And that is in your hands America."}

Whenever Reagan spoke of states rights he could be interpreted as saying that the southern states had a right to determine their policies on slavery, gun control, abortion, birth control, <profanity>gay</profanity> rights, rather than giving in to a federal law. When Romney spoke of the \"47% who pay no income taxes\" he was appealing to the rich Republicans. <br/><br/>So, there are no more than half-truths and half-apologies in Wehner's analysis. Only when he and others in his party openly disavow these people and their beliefs without using coded language will the Republicans find their way back to Lincoln."}

He starts off being a little contrite and introspective and wonders if the pundits (a category in which he places himself, which in of itself supposedly shows humility even as he is bragging about his status as a knowledgeable pundit) really understands the collective minds of the American public. He notes that fear mongering was believed to be a true and tried technique to appeal to the American public. With a great deal of certitude he writes, \"This we know.\"<br/><br/>But then along comes the massacre in Orlando. And the Donald tries to stoke fear, the definitive way to increase his appeal, as \"we know.\" But his poll numbers tanked.  And immediately Tomasky formulates another theory of how the American voter's mind works. One event, one poll. Enough to construct yet another theory.<br/><br/>Maybe Tomasky is right. In fact there is a part of me that is rooting that he be right. But he is wrong in so quickly coming to this conclusion. Punditry is more than following one poll. Just ask Nate Silver!"}

who they learned was an evangelical.\u201d He brands this a form of bigotry, but that is not where the matter stops. The evangelical begins to nudge the scriptures and fights the university\u2019s health care policy because it includes contraception. At that stage it is no longer bigotry to resist an evangelical.<br/><br/>Second, Kristof laments the lack of diversity and notes that only one professor in 10 in the humanities or social sciences is a Republican.\u201d Today\u2019s Republican party has become anti-intellectual. And that is in direct conflict with any university\u2019s mission, i.e., plant and nurture seeds of intellectual curiosity. It seems only natural to avoid an anti-intellectual party.<br/><br/>Third, Kristof warns that when academics cluster at one end of the political spectrum, they will marginalize themselves. In sociology and anthropology, at the very least one would expect researchers to have respect for their human subjects. If you look at the rhetoric of many Republicans, it is clear that they have very little respect for human life unless it is an embryo or a yet-to-born fetus.<br/><br/>I applaud Kristof\u2019s effort to have a balanced analysis of the academic community but absent very fundamental changes in the right\u2019s views and attitudes, academics will continue to cluster at the left end of the political spectrum."}

Simply because politics is not like a reality show and only active participation by the younger folks (who are known to be very fickle and have a low turnout at the polls) can blunt the dangerous trend of making campaigning a reality TV show.

But a President giving a nuanced analysis of nuclear weapons is seen as weakness. Those who wish to anoint America the greatest country don't seem to understand that such recognition has to be accorded by others and is never given by oneself."}

This too has been displaced by the term \"stay-at-home\" prefix to a mother or father. <br/><br/>Famously Juliet says \"What's in a name? that which we call a rose<br/>By any other name would smell as sweet.\" But in the real world in which we live, we do not merely identify an object by using a term, we also imply many other characteristics.

This did not make it right, but they did not advertise their conquests. In fact, many used to argue that their flings were not the country's problem.<br/><br/>So what makes the Donald's philandering different. Times are different; these are the days when news travels faster than the speed of light.. And if anything people are more understanding and accommodating nowadays. Nonetheless, there is more than a whiff of crassness in the way the Donald speaks about his sexploits and women, even his own wife and daughters. He looked at Tiffany, his daughter, when she was a few weeks old baby and gushed at the prospect of her developing voluptuous breasts. He has publicly stated that he'd date his daughter Ivana if only she were not his daughter. He has spoken about avoiding STDs just like avoiding being drafted to Vietnam.<br/><br/>So even though times are different and social mores in regards sex have evolved since the days of JFK, the Donald makes it crass. And that is a unique skill he has like no one else."}

There was a time, just after WWII or so, when many Americans started to move up in life with an economic expansion resulting from technological innovations and a robust manufacturing economy. All of that slowed down as the world morphed into one giant community with the elimination of the First, Second and Third worlds and the onset of globalization. These past 25+ years have been hard on the lower and uneducated class of Americans who saw jobs leaving our country even as people in China and India saw an economic expansion. <br/><br/>Most would agree with my review thus far, although disagreements may begin now onward. American in the lower and uneducated class tended to support the Republican party although the party's policies post Reagan were never really in this group's favor. And now Donald Trump has exposed that yawning gap resulting in his massive support. Most of the racist and xenophobic tendencies only reflect a deeper economic malaise. <br/><br/>Whoever is the next President will have to invest in our country's science &amp; technology and infrastructure - these seem the most obvious ways to reinvigorate our economy."}

As a growing child if you see a parent or a close family friend drink responsibly, you also learn to moderate your own consumption later in life. However, if you see the same adults drink excessively and engage in abusive behaviors, sadly you learn the opposite behaviors."}
